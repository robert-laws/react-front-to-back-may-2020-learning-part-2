# Learning - May 2020 - React Front to Back - part 2

Code along with project 2 of React Front to Back

[Running Website Example](https://robdlaws-mern-contact-keeper.herokuapp.com/)

#### Development Environment

Features include:

* MongoDB that persists data to a database

* Express that handles server requests and API routes

* ReactJS that builds the UI and handles a lot of the app logic

* Node that facilitates running javascript on the server and the interactions between the client, server, and database

Also used in my app:

* [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io)

* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

#### The App

The concept of the app is a password-protected website that allows users to register and login. Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page. Once logged into the app, users can view, edit and delete their existing contact list. Users can also add a new contact. There's also an *About* page. Once a user is finished with the app, they can logout.
